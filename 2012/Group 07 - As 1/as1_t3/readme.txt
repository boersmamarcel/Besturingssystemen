Our threading system has a global threadlimit, and a global int to count the current alive threads. A mutex object is used to ensure safe write/reading of this counter. Every time merge_sort() is called, the threadlimit is checked, and if there are still threads left, a new thread is spawned for the left side of the array, while the right side of the array continues on the current thread. Before merging both sides, a join function is called to wait on the left side thread to finish.
